** short term todo

** middle term todo

* use autoconf.

* use the option -d for cvs log.

* support revision translation.

* support tag translation.

** long term todo

* don't use cvs command by talking cvs client/server protocol directly.

* handle dead state more properly. (valuable? possible?)

  Currently, a revision which state is dead has empty contents.
  But real repository may not.
  (For example, dead revision is same as the revision just before.)
