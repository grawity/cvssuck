.TH CVSSUCK 1 "25 September 2000"
.SH NAME
cvssuck \- inefficient cvs repository grabber via cvs client/server protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvssuck
.RB [ -s ]
.RB [ -t
.IR trunk-tag ]
.RB [ -o 
.IR output-directory ]
.I cvsroot module
.SH DESCRIPTION
  CVSsuck grabs
.I module
in 
.IR cvsroot .

  CVSsuck is a cvs repository mirroring tool.  Unlike other tools such
as CVSup or rsync, it works via cvs client/server protocol.  So, it
doesn't require a special server or shell account.  However it is
inefficient because cvs client/server protocol is not designed for
mirroring.  If a server provides special way to grab a repository, you
should use it and don't use CVSsuck.

  CVSsuck can translate revision numbers and tags when mirroring.  For
example, it can copy the revision 1.1 in remote repository to the
revision 1.1.999.1.1.1 in local repository.
This makes development with local repository possible.
In other words, CVSsuck can be used as
replacement of `cvs import'.  If CVSsuck is used instead, you can refer
logs, original tags, revisions between releases, etc.

  Note that `cvs import' works well with CVSsuck until 500th vendor
branch is created :-)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-o " output-directory"
specifies output directory.
The default is 
.IR module .
.TP
.B \-s
specifies skeleton mode.
In this mode, CVSsuck grabs only 
first revision of the trunk, 1.1, branchpoints, head of branches and tagged revisions.
Note that first two (first revision of the trunk and 1.1) is identical in usual case.
.TP
.BI \-t " trunk-tag"
specifies revision/tag translation mode.
In the mode, CVSsuck translates revisions and tags.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B "% cvssuck :pserver:anonymous@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/cvs cvssuck"

  This grabs the module
.B cvssuck
in the repository
.B :pserver:anonymous@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/cvs
into the directory
.B cvssuck.
